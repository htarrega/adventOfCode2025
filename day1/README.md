# Complexity Analysis

## Part 1: Count Final Positions at 0
- **Time:** O(N) - iterate through n rotations, where N is the number of lines
- **Space:** O(1) - fixed variables only

## Part 2: Count All Traversals Through 0
- **Time:** O(N) - iterate through n rotations, where N is the number of lines
- **Space:** O(1) - fixed variables only
