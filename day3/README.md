# Complexity Analysis

## Part 1:
- **Time:** O(M(N+N-2)) = O(M*2N) = O(MN) - where M is the number of lines and N the length of that line (assuming all equal).
- **Space:** O(N) - Line storage.

## Part 2:
- **Time:** O(M*12N) = O(MN) - where M is the number of lines and N the length of that line (assuming all equal).
- **Space:** O(N) - Line storage.
